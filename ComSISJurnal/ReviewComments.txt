Comments:

1. The manuscript should be better structured.

2. The initial hypotheses to be tested are missing.

3. Researchers questions to be answered in the manuscript are missing.

4. Experiments should be focused on verification of the research questions according to the hypotheses.

5. The section regarding threads to validity is missing.

6. Maybe the title should be slightly corrected so that it better reflects the structure of the paper.

7. Chapters 2 and 3 begin with elaboration, and it would be nice to get an introductory paragraph 
describing a given chapter, as it exists in Chapter 4.

8. The conclusion should be better structured. The given conclusion has many short passages and 
has a lot of references. There are usually three separate parts in the conclusion. The first part 
usually gives an overview of what the manuscript was about, the second part gives a critical overview
of what was achieved, and the third part gives some perspective for future work.

9. In reference [16], I am not sure does the number 0.894 refers to the solution presented in the 
referred paper or to the solution that the refereed paper was compared to. One result from the 
referred paper is 0.890. If this is a mistake please check other members.
COMMENTS:
-> see [16] jurnal paper; value 0.894 is the avg of table5 avg : (0.889 + 0.890 + 0.903)/3
-> maybe add small explination that we did the average

10. In many places in the manuscript it was used the third person "we" which is more suitable for
