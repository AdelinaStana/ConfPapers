1. Research questions should be slightly rephrased or they explanations expanded. From the questions itself it is unclear what are results previously obtained that will be enhance
by combining logical dependencies with structural dependencies.
The research questions should be slightly reformulated or the explanations expanded.

2. In Section 2.4, some equations and relations are introduced. It would be nice to see the values they return on selected datasets (Ant and Hibernate).

3. It would be nice to improve the image quality of Figure 2 and Figure 3. Currently, some dots appear solid black, while others appear in different shades of gray, and also their size varies.

4. It would also be nice to show a pair of histograms corresponding to Figure 2 and Figure 3 that represent all occurrences between entities, not just the maximum ones.

5. In the rest of the manuscript three datasets were used and in Section 2.4 data regarding only two datasets were shown. It would be nice to show data regarding Tomcat Catalina also.

6. It would be nice to name y axis on Figure 4, not only in the text.

7. In Section 5.4 it would be nice to have a table concerning Tomcat key classes like tables regarding key classes concerning Ant and Hibernate. If the content of the table is too large, only the top classes can be represented.

8. In Section 5.4 it would be nice to explain how these key classes were identified.
